This is a game of a rover trying to survive in a mad world.

The game is not yet finished. A lot of features can be inserted: 

1.  Trophies, that he has to collect in one level to win it.
2.  Increasing numbers of robots with always incresing speed hunting him and more obstacles.
3.  Robots that get faster over time the rover survived.
4.  A game mode where the rover has to survive for a certain time.
5.  A game mode where he has to get through a labyrinth of obstacles to get to the trophy.


Also a lot of technical issues could still be adressed as well - for example that rovers can't touch each other on the same field, obstacles that can only be in one field and don't overlap, the starting point of the robots can't be the same as the rover's.


This game is part of the Ironhack Pre-Work.
